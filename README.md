# Wolf Dog Project üê∂

## Overview

This script defines a simple Python function named `wolf_dog` that prints "woof" to the console. It is a basic example of how to define and call functions in Python.

## Function Definition

### `wolf_dog()`

This function demonstrates a basic concept in Python programming. Here‚Äôs what it does:

- **Definition:** The function `wolf_dog` is defined using the `def` keyword. This tells Python that we are creating a function.
- **Function Body:** Inside the function, the `print("woof")` statement outputs the string "woof" to the console.
- **Calling the Function:** After defining the function, we call it using `wolf_dog()`. This triggers the function to execute its code and print "woof".

### Example Usage

To use the `wolf_dog` function, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Code:**
   Copy the following code into a Python file (e.g., `main.py`):

    ```python
    def wolf_dog():
        print("woof")
        
    # Call the function
    wolf_dog()
    ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the Python file. You can do this from the command line by navigating to the directory containing the file and running:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Expected Output:**
   The console should display:

    ```
    woof
    ```

## Explanation

- **Function Definition:** The `def` keyword is used to start the definition of a function. The function name `wolf_dog` is followed by parentheses and a colon.
- **Function Body:** The body of the function is indented and contains the `print("woof")` statement, which is executed when the function is called.
- **Function Call:** The `wolf_dog()` line outside of the function definition calls the function, causing the string "woof" to be printed to the console.

This simple example illustrates how to create and use functions in Python. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called multiple times throughout a program.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system to run the script.
- This example is intended to demonstrate basic function usage and can be expanded with more complex functionality.
